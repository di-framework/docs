# Resource Authorization

`@di-framework/authz` adds declarative, resource-oriented policy decisions while `@di-framework/auth` remains policy-neutral. Install both packages when an application needs local resource policies:

```bash
bun add @di-framework/auth @di-framework/authz
```

## Author a policy

```typescript
@Policy('document')
class DocumentPolicy {
  @Allow('read') @HasScope('documents:read') read() {}
  @Allow('update', 'delete') @Owner() own() {}
  @Allow('delete') @HasRole('admin') admin() {}
  @Deny('update', 'delete') @Equals('resource.locked', true) locked() {}
}
```

The methods are instance-method metadata declarations and are never instantiated or invoked. Conditions on one method are ANDed. Separate allow methods form OR alternatives. Any matching deny wins, and no matching allow denies.

Multi-argument role and scope predicates are intentionally different: `@HasRole('admin', 'editor')` matches when the subject has any listed role, while `@HasScope('documents:read', 'documents:write')` requires every listed scope. To require every role, stack one-role decorators on the same method so the conditions are ANDed. To accept any scope, declare separate allow methods with one `@HasScope` each so the methods are OR alternatives.

`@Owner()` defaults to `subject.id === resource.ownerId`. `@Equals` structurally compares JSON values; missing attributes and unsafe paths never match. Declarations reject empty actions, mixed allow/deny methods, duplicate resources or rule IDs, unsafe paths, and unsupported predicates.

## EBNF documents

`compilePolicies()` produces the same AST accepted directly by the evaluator. `printPolicies()` emits deterministic ISO/IEC 14977-style EBNF and `parsePolicies()` parses the documented authorization subset, including comments, action alternatives, comma-separated conditions, and the four v1 predicates.

```ebnf
policy DocumentPolicy = "document" ;

allow DocumentPolicy updateOwn =
  "update",
  ? owner "subject.id" "resource.ownerId" ? ;

deny DocumentPolicy locked =
  ("update" | "delete"),
  ? equals "resource.locked" true ? ;
```

`printPolicies(parsePolicies(text))` is canonical and stable. A manager accepts exactly one source: omitted `policies` takes a one-time snapshot of the decorator registry when `policyAuthorizationManager()` is called, a string is parsed, and a `PolicyDocument` is used directly. Sources are not merged. Import all decorated policy classes before creating a manager so the snapshot is complete.

## Load trusted resources

Providers implement `load(id, context)` and return a trusted record or `null`/`undefined`. Supply a provider instance directly, or a registered class/string token for DI resolution:

```typescript
const authorization = policyAuthorizationManager({
  providers: { document: DocumentResourceProvider },
});
registerAuth({ secret, authorization });
```

Member requests require an ID and invoke the provider. Collection actions do not. Missing IDs or records deny as `resource-unavailable`; provider rejection, timeout, and invalid provider values are infrastructure failures and propagate. Missing policy/provider setup throws rather than silently denying a misconfigured application.

The default subject mapping copies `principal.sub` to `subject.id`, scopes to `subject.scopes`, valid string-array `claims.roles` to roles, and raw claims to `subject.claims`.

## Bind HTTP controllers

```typescript
@ResourceAuthorization(DocumentPolicy)
@Controller()
class DocumentsController {
  @Endpoint({ summary: 'Read a document' })
  static read = secure.get('/documents/:id', readDocument);
}
```

Decorator order is deliberate: `@ResourceAuthorization` must be stacked above `@Controller`. It scans direct static routes created by `withAuthRoutes`, and authentication runs before its deferred policy check. Plain router handlers, aliases, inherited or late routes, unsupported shapes, and any route-level `authorization` option (even `false`) fail during class definition. String resource references support remote-policy decoupling; class references are resolved by constructor identity and require registration in the package's shared decorator registry.

Actions infer fail-closed: GET collection/member becomes `list`/`read`, POST collection becomes `create`, PUT/PATCH member becomes `update`, and DELETE member becomes `delete`. Ambiguous routes require `@ResourceAction`. The default ID parameter is `id`. `@Endpoint` still owns OpenAPI documentation; resource authorization neither replaces it nor adds a vendor extension.

Decisions expose a stable category (`allow-rule-matched`, `explicit-deny`, `no-matching-allow`, or `resource-unavailable`) plus sorted decisive rule IDs. These travel as log-only authorization detail to HTTP/GraphQL denial hooks. Serialized errors remain generic and do not disclose policy structure.

## Bind GraphQL Resolvers

`@di-framework/authz/graphql` connects declarative resource policies to GraphQL queries, mutations, subscriptions, and field resolvers:

```typescript
import { GraphQLResourceAuthorization, protectGraphQLField, ResourceAction } from '@di-framework/authz/graphql';

// 1. Class Decorator on Resolver Service
class ArticleResolver {
  @GraphQLResourceAuthorization(ArticlePolicy)
  @ResourceAction('read')
  async findOne(parent: any, args: { id: string }, ctx: any, info: any) {
    return articleService.find(args.id);
  }
}

// 2. Resolver Wrapper
const protectedResolver = protectGraphQLField(ArticlePolicy, rawResolver, {
  idArg: (args) => args.id,
  action: 'read',
});
```

- Reuses the core AST, evaluator, and `ResourceProvider` infrastructure without introducing a separate policy language.
- Action inference detects `list`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, or `read` based on field names, or uses `@ResourceAction`.
- Missing or ambiguous resource IDs fail closed immediately.
- Client error responses sanitize decision details (`ruleIds`, `category`) and return standard `GraphQLResourcePolicyError` (`FORBIDDEN`/`UNAUTHENTICATED`).
